**News:** I'm currently occupied with [this program](http://code.google.com/p/7plus/), and it doesn't look like I'm going to work on this for quite a while. However, I welcome anyone to join this project!

Ever recorded/downloaded/ripped a TV show just to have lots of garbled filenames which don’t tell you anything? Too many files to rename them manually? That’s where this program kicks in. Many filenames of series have something like "S1E05″ or similar in them, with S standing for season, and E for episode. This allows to search for this episode on the internet and figure out the title. Once the title is known, the file can be renamed to some meaningful name, like "Series Name - S1E05 - Series Title.avi" or similar. That’s the basic concept of this program. Open up a folder, select which files you want to rename, enter a Series Name and click on "Get Titles!", see if you’re happy with the results, press “Rename!” and you’re done.
